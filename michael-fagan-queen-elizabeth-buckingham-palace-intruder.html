So much so that no one heard the queen’s night alarm bell and her two calls to send the police to her bedroom didn’t set off any urgency because of her calm tone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But in fact, minutes before, a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-fagan-her-nightie-was-one-those-liberty-prints-down-her-knees-7179547.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="strange man had just pulled back the curtains " class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">strange man had just pulled back the curtains </a>of the queen’s bed with a bloody hand and a piece of an ashtray he had just broken in an anteroom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Michael Fagan, a 33-year-old London-born unemployed man, had somehow managed to stay undetected through all the palace security, becoming the best-known Buckingham Palace intruder.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Fagan had first broken into the palace the previous month</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The shocking feat seemed like it would have taken meticulous planning and maneuvering, but apparently, it was simply a series of odd happenstances that led Fagan into the Queen’s chambers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And even more surprising, it wasn’t his first time there. On June 7, 1982, Fagan, whose wife had just left him, climbed through a maid’s bedroom window into Buckingham Palace with one mission in mind: to use the restroom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I found rooms saying ‘Diana’s Room,’ ‘Charles’ Room,’ — they all had names on them. But I couldn't find a door which said ‘WC,’” Fagan told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-fagan-her-nightie-was-one-those-liberty-prints-down-her-knees-7179547.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent UK" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Independent UK</a>. “All I found were some bins with ‘Corgi Food’ written on them. I was breaking my neck to go to the toilet. What do I do? Pee on the carpet? So I had to pee on the corgi food. I got into Charles' room and took the wine off the shelf and [drank] it. It was cheap Californian.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He claims to have wandered through the palace, trying chairs “like Goldilocks and the Three Bears” — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/world/palace-intruder-is-acquitted-by-london-jury.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="claiming he even tried out the throne" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">claiming he even tried out the throne</a> — and exploring various rooms before walking out a door to the back gardens.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">One month later, Fagan broke into the palace again</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After his royal jaunt, still reeling from the pain of his wife leaving him, Fagan stole a car in London and drove it to Stonehenge, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-fagan-her-nightie-was-one-those-liberty-prints-down-her-knees-7179547.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="looking for her" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">looking for her</a>. He was arrested for the auto theft and spent three weeks in a Brixton jail before being released on bail. And the day after he was free again, he went back to his favorite new playground.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Around 6:45 a.m., he climbed over the railings of the gates near Buckingham Palace's ambassador’s entrance and entered the building through an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/text-of-scotland-yard-s-report-on-july-9-intrusion-into-buckingham-palace.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="unlocked window" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">unlocked window</a> into a room with the Royal Stamp Collection. The doors to the rest of the palace were locked, but that didn’t deter Fagan — as he set his sights higher.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He went back out the window and climbed a drainpipe to the roof, where he found an unlocked window which had been opened for the day by a maid. He left his sandals and socks on the roof and entered into the office of Sir Peter Ashmore, the Master of the Household.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Without catching anyone’s eye, he wandered the halls of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.royal.uk/royal-residences-buckingham-palace data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="775-room palace" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">775-room palace</a>, which has 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms.</p><img alt="An artist's depiction of Michael Fagan sitting at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's bed" title="An artist's depiction of Michael Fagan sitting at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's bed" width=5236 height=3775 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-elizabeth-intruder-gettyimages-639738426.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Staff/Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span><p>An artist’s depiction of Michael Fagan sitting at the end of Queen Elizabeth II’s bed</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Fagan considered slashing his wrists in front of the Queen</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Claiming he had no prior plan, Fagan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/text-of-scotland-yard-s-report-on-july-9-intrusion-into-buckingham-palace.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=says class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">says</a> he found his way to the private apartments by “following the pictures."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the first anteroom, he saw an ashtray and suddenly came up with a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/text-of-scotland-yard-s-report-on-july-9-intrusion-into-buckingham-palace.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="new action plan" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">new action plan</a>. He broke the astray and “said that he intended to slash his wrists in the presence of Her Majesty.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With a piece of the broken ashtray in his hand, Fagan entered Her Majesty’s bedroom and opened the curtains of her bed. Decades later, he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/michael-fagan-her-nightie-was-one-those-liberty-prints-down-her-knees-7179547.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent UK" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Independent UK</a>, “It was a double bed but a single room, definitely – she was sleeping in there on her own. Her nightie was one of those Liberty prints and it was down to her knees.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen pushed her night alarm bell, but since it was after the night police’s shift and no one was in the corridor or the pantry where it rings, it went unanswered. She then used the telephone by her bed, telling the palace’s telephonist to send police to her room. The police lodge received the call at 7:18 a.m.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Six minutes later, no help had arrived, so she called again. While she continued to wait, the Queen was able to catch the eye of a maid — and two worked together to lead Fagan into a pantry by offering him a cigarette. During this time, the footman returned from walking the dogs and helped occupy Fagan while the queen tended to her beloved corgis. Eventually, the police did show up and removed him from the palace.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fagan remembers the incident differently, telling <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/text-of-scotland-yard-s-report-on-july-9-intrusion-into-buckingham-palace.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent UK" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Independent UK</a> that as soon as the Queen saw him, “She went past me and ran out of the room; her little bare feet running across the floor.”</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">With a generally relaxed security protocol, palace break-ins were not uncommon.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A complete investigation was launched, concluding that a failure in communication between police officers may have been the cause. One officer had seen Fagan climbing the railings and passed along the message, but no action was taken. An alarm in the first Stamp Room also went unanswered. But ultimately it was the “inadequate” response to the Queen’s calls that truly posed the biggest risk, according to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/text-of-scotland-yard-s-report-on-july-9-intrusion-into-buckingham-palace.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scotland Yards report" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Scotland Yards report</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This incident was not an isolated one. Palace break-ins were not entirely uncommon, especially during that time. On June 19, 1981, three Germans made it into the gardens by climbing a wall, thinking they were going into Hyde Park; on August 5, 1981, a 24-year-old man was found on the palace grounds and taken into psychiatric care; and on June 17, 1982, a 25-year-old showed a knife to bypass two guards.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The royal family’s security may have seemed lax by American standards, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/22/world/british-attribute-palace-intrusion-to-police-errors.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The New York Times</a> said, stating, “Traditionally, the royal family has preferred a minimum of security so as to limit the disruption to their lives and the barriers from the people.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While more measures were put in place after the 1979 killing of Earl Mountbatten by the Irish Republican Army, they still weren’t quite as sealed as one would imagine for the world’s most famous monarch. More stringent security measures were put into place after the Fagan break-in, including around-the-clock security by the royal apartments.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Fagan was not charged for the intrusion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that Fagan was not charged in the incident since a palace spokesperson said he had simply trespassed, which is a civil law violation, but <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/world/palace-intruder-is-acquitted-by-london-jury.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="not a crime" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">not a crime</a> in Britain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Instead, it was actually his first incident in June that sent him to court because drinking Prince Charles’ wine was considered “stealing.” The jury <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/24/world/palace-intruder-is-acquitted-by-london-jury.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="acquitted him" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">acquitted him</a> in 14 minutes that September.
