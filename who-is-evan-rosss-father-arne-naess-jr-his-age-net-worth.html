He’s perhaps remembered best for having been the second husband of famous American singer and actress Diana Ross, and the father of famous American actor and musician Evan Olav Ross- Næss.</p><p>Arne was passionate about mountain climbing, and in 1985 climbed Mount Everest with a Norwegian expedition which he led; he <a rel=nofollow href=#>died in a climbing accident</a> on 13 January 2004, aged 66, when his equipment loosened while he was descending from a peak outside Cape Town, South Africa and he fell over 100m. He was posthumously awarded a Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award in May 2004.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/standard_compressed_Q0r14QEtDgg.jpg><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Arne was raised in Germany during World War II by his Norwegian mother Kirsten ‘Kiki’ Dekke Næss who died in 2001 aged 94, and German physician father August Oskar German Raab, who was 92 when he passed away in 1993; his uncle Arne Deke Eide Næss was a Norwegian philosopher and mountaineer.</p><p>After the war ended, Kirsten and August divorced and Arne <a rel=nofollow href=#>moved to Norway</a> with his mother, while he also took his mother’s maiden name. He studied at a local high school there, and was into numerous activities during his teenage years, including mountaineering; by the time he turned 17, Arne had already made 20 first ascents on Norwegian mountains.</p><p>He matriculated in 1955, and then enrolled at college, graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in 1959.</p><h2><span id=Arnes_career>Arne’s career</span></h2><p>Arne moved to New York State, USA in 1964 and began working for his Norwegian shipping magnate uncle Erling Dekke Næss; this led to Arne founding his own oil and shipping business four years later, after which he also ventured into real estate.</p><p>The ‘90s saw him make a couple of bad investments, while his best was perhaps in Tandberg Data, an IT company headquartered in Dortmund, Germany.</p><p>He continued working until his death, and mostly lived in Switzerland.</p><h2><span id=Love_life_and_wife>Love life and wife</span></h2><p>Arne was married twice. His first wife was Swedish non-celebrity Filippa Kumplin d’Orey, and they had three children together, daughters Leona and Katinka, and son Christoffer. Leona’s today a popular British singer-songwriter who released her debut album “Comatised” in March 2000, while she’s since released four more albums.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Arne and Filippa eventually divorced, and he was then in a relationship with Mari Maurstad, a famous Norwegian actress.</p><p>Arne was on a trip to the Bahamas when he met Diana Ross in 1985; they exchanged vows in 1986, and she gave birth to their sons Evan Olav Næss and Ross Arne Næss.

Evan reprised his role in the 2015 sequel “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2”.</p><p>Evan was thrown into the entertainment industry at a quite an early age, as he <a rel=nofollow href=#>was only three when</a> his mother cast him to appear in her 1991 music video “Diana Ross: When You Tell Me That You Love Me”.</p><p>He studied at Greenwich High School, and his first notable performance was portraying Ant in the 2006 crime comedy movie “ATL”, starring alongside Lauren London and Tip ‘T.
