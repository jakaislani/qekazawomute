In the film, Quan played the character of Data, a gadget-loving member of a group of young friends who embark on a treasure hunt. “The Goonies” was also a huge success and has since become a beloved classic among fans of the 1980s.</p><p>After his success in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom” and “The Goonies”, Quan continued to act in films, although his roles became less frequent as he got older. He appeared in the films “Breathing Fire” (1991), “Encino Man” (1992), and “Head of the Class” (1996).
