This was due to Ken Jeong, one of the show’s panelists, leaving the set.</p><p>This prompted everyone to wonder, <strong>“Why did Ken Jeong leave Masked Singer?” </strong>The show began normally enough, with masked singers such as The Prince, Baby Mammoth, Queen Cobra, Space Bunny, and Jack in the Box. Jenny McCarthy, Robin Thicke, and Nicole Scherzinger, along with Jeong, attempted to guess who the singers were behind the masks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ken-Jeong-1.jpg><p>Jack in the Box performed ‘Bad to the Bone by George Thorogood & the Destroyers and dropped several hints about his identity. Following Jack in the Box’s performance on Week 7 of ‘The Masked Singer,’ Ken Jeong exited the stage.</p><p>He was the only one of the five masked singers to be eliminated from the show because he received fewer votes from the audience and the panel. That meant he had to remove his mask and reveal his true identity. And when he did, he stunned both the panelists and the audience to the point where Jeong left the set.</p><h2>Why Did Ken Jeong Depart from Masked Singer?</h2><p>When the panelists were asked to guess who the Jack in the Box was, they thought the singer was Joe Pesci, Al Roker, Elon Musk, or Robert Duvall. However, after the mask was removed, it was revealed to be none other than Rudy Giuliani.</p><p>Giuliani was New York City’s mayor, a lawyer, and a supporter of former President Donald Trump. As a result, it was unsurprising that Jeong was opposed to Giuliani’s participation in the competition, given that the actor has always been critical of Trump’s actions.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I think <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@kenjeong</a> speaks for us all in this picture & when he walked out. You don’t feature someone who helped try to over throw our government and represented a deplorable Pres who’s responsible for nearly 1 million deaths in 18 months. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#FuckYouFox</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#MaskedSinger</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wfLMYBmPdB</a></p><p>— sheeple on the tv (@djbtv) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">April 21, 2022</a></p><p>After the unmasking, Giuliani surprised everyone on set, and Jeong appeared to be uncomfortable with his presence. He stood with his arms crossed and did not converse with Giuliani.<br>The latter explained that he was on the show because of his granddaughter, Grace. He wanted her to understand that she should “try everything, even things that are completely unlike you and unlikely.”</p><p>The Masked Singer fit into that category for Giuliani, so he entered the competition. He then performed his farewell performance, which eliminated singers do before departing for good.</p><p>Jeong stood up from his seat, a displeased expression on his face, just as Giuliani was about to begin. He walked out of the set after looking off-camera and saying, “I’m done.” In February 2022, Deadline reported that Thicke, along with his co-panelist, left the set in protest. However, no footage of the ‘Blurred Lines’ singer leaving was shown.</p><p>Thicke allegedly left to check on Jeong, but McCarthy and Scherzinger stayed to watch Giuliani’s performance. Similarly, Jeong and Thicke are said to have returned later to judge the rest of the season.</p><h2>Rudy Giuliani’s Scandals</h2><p>It’s clear that Jeong skipped Giuliani’s performance because he doesn’t agree with him. Giuliani has been embroiled in a number of controversies involving Trump and the 2020 election.</p><p>An appeals court ruled that Giuliani made false statements about the 2020 presidential election. According to reports, there was “uncontroverted evidence” against him.<br>It was determined that Giuliani “made demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers, and the general public in his capacity as a lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump and his campaign.” As a result, he will be barred from practicing law in New York State beginning in June 2021.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecqepWailaS7qHnLnpivnV2irrS3xJ1krKGenLKzew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jessica-lange-net-worth-155651.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jessica Lange Net Worth</a>
